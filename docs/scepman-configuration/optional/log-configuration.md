# Log configuration

## App Service Logs

To retain or archive the log files, we can configure the **Application logging \(Blob\)** and **Web server logging** in the **App Service**.

1. Go to your **App Service** and navigate to **App Service logs** under **Monitoring** 
2. Activate **Application logging \(Blob\)** and set the **Level** to **Verbose**
3. Under **Storage Settings** you can select a storage account and container where you want to store the log files.
4. In the filed **Retention Period \(Days\)** you can enter how long your log files will be retained. We recommend **30** days.
5. The next part is to activate the **Web server logging** by selecting **Storage**.
6. Under **Storage Settings** you can select a storage account and container where you want to store the log files.
7. In the filed **Retention Period \(Days\)** you can enter how long your log files will be retained. We recommend **30** days.
