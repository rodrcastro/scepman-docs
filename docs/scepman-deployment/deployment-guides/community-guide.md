## Azure Deployment

LetÂ´s start with the requirements and a resource overview.\
Keep in mind that you need to plan a useful Azure resource design.

### Checklist pre-requirements

* [ ] Azure resource naming convention
* [ ] Azure subscription
* [ ] Azure contributor rights (at least on Resource Group level)
* [ ] Azure AD "Global administrator" (Consent to access Graph API)
* [ ] Public Domain CNAME (_scepman.yourdomain.com_)
* [ ] SSL (Wildcard-)Certificate (or use [App Service Managed Certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate#create-a-free-certificate-preview))

### Overview Azure Resource

All these resources are deployed for a Community Edition environment.

| Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Azure App Registration

Before we can start the resource deployment, we need to create an "Azure App Registration".

{% content-ref url="../permissions/azure-app-registration.md" %}
[azure-app-registration.md](../permissions/azure-app-registration.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Step 2: Deploy SCEPman base services

To start with the deployment, you need to follow our Setup instruction:

{% content-ref url="../deployment-options/marketplace-deployment.md" %}
[marketplace-deployment.md](../deployment-options/marketplace-deployment.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Step 3: Create Root certificate

After the deployment completed you need to create the root certificate:

{% content-ref url="../first-run-root-cert.md" %}
[first-run-root-cert.md](../first-run-root-cert.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Step 4: Configure a Custom Domain and SSL certificate

To have your SCEPman available under your specific domain you need to create a **Custom Domain** in the **App Service.**

{% content-ref url="../../advanced-configuration/custom-domain.md" %}
[custom-domain.md](../../advanced-configuration/custom-domain.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Step 5: Deploy Storage Account and change Artifacts

The next step is to configure the Storage account and change the Artifact location in your App Service.

{% content-ref url="../../advanced-configuration/application-artifacts.md" %}
[application-artifacts.md](../../advanced-configuration/application-artifacts.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend the production channel.
{% endhint %}

### Step 6: Configure Log collection

You can configure two different logging parts in your App Service, to retain your log data. The one part is the **App Service Logs**, which will save all application and IIS server-based log data. The other part is the **Diagnostic settings**, this contains platform logs and metrics data.

{% content-ref url="../../advanced-configuration/log-configuration.md" %}
[log-configuration.md](../../advanced-configuration/log-configuration.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the storage account we created in **Step 4** and create two new blob containers. This blob containers can be selected in the **App Service Logs** instructions. In the **Diagnostic settings** you can directly choose the storage account and blob containers will be created automatically.
{% endhint %}

### Step 7: Deploy Application Insights

The Application Insights can be used to get an overview of the App Service performance and to get deeper insights of the request processing of SCEPman. We recommend to always configure Application Insights to monitor, maintain and optimize the App Service.

{% content-ref url="../../advanced-configuration/application-insights.md" %}
[application-insights.md](../../advanced-configuration/application-insights.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Step 8: Configure Health check

We can configure a Health check for the App Service to get direct notifications in case that the SCEPman stops working.

{% content-ref url="../../advanced-configuration/health-check.md" %}
[health-check.md](../../advanced-configuration/health-check.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Step 9: Configure Intune deployment profiles

With the completion of the first steps, we have a working SCEPman implementation and can now deploy certificates to our devices.

In the Endpoint Manager (Intune) you can create Configuration profiles for various platforms. Choose your OS platform from the below links:

{% content-ref url="../../certificate-deployment/microsoft-intune/windows-10.md" %}
[windows-10.md](../../certificate-deployment/microsoft-intune/windows-10.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../certificate-deployment/microsoft-intune/macos.md" %}
[macos.md](../../certificate-deployment/microsoft-intune/macos.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../certificate-deployment/microsoft-intune/ios.md" %}
[ios.md](../../certificate-deployment/microsoft-intune/ios.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../certificate-deployment/microsoft-intune/android.md" %}
[android.md](../../certificate-deployment/microsoft-intune/android.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Step 10: Enjoy the ease of SCEPman certificate deployment

After configuration of the Intune profiles, we will get your certificates to your devices and can start using them. Now enjoy SCEPman and if you have any questions please contact us. Further details can be found on [https://scepman.com](https://scepman.com)
